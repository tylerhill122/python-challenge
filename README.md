# ------------------------------- #

The purpose of this repository is to test our knowledge of Python by showcasing 
our thought process and how we approach real world data problems.

# ------------PyBank------------- #

The objective of PyBank was to import raw data from a csv file and perform 
rudimentary analysis of budget data over time using Python, then to display 
those results both in the terminal and in the creation of a new textfile.
The following were calculated:
    * Total number of months in dataset
    * Net Profit / Loss over total time period
    * Average change in P / L over total time period
    * Greatest increase and decrease in profits over total time period
        and their corresponding dates

# ------------PyPoll------------- #

With PyPoll the objective was to import local election data from a csv file 
and to simplify the results and declare a winner. The results are printed 
in the terminal and a new textfile is created displaying the results. 
Voter ID, County, and the Candidate were included in the dataset. 
From this, the following were calculated:
    * Total # of votes cast
    * List of unique candidates who received votes:
        * Percentage of votes per candidate
        * Total # of votes per candidate
    * Declaring the winner based on popular vote count
